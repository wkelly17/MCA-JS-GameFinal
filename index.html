              "Oww.... My head is killing me. And where am I?" You realize that
              you're in a room, but it's not a room you've ever seen before. You
              are a spy who was assigned to gather intel on the infamous
              criminal Giorgio Lamparella. He specializes in art crimes, but
              he's willing to make a deal for anything if the price is right.
              You notice a note in front of you. It says, "Shame shame... I'm
              not a violent man. I really prefer to enjoy art and share it, and
              you want to go and ruin that. Now you know too much, and your time
              has come to an unfortunate end. Nevertheless, I like to give
              everyone a second chance... Find your way out of this house in the
              next 30 minutes, and your life is yours... Should you not, well...
              Let's say there is a bomb with your name on it in this building...
              Yours truly, con amore Signor G
